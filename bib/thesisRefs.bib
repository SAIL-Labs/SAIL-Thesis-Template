	Abstract = {
The High Efficiency and Resolution Multi Element Spectrograph, HERMES is an optical spectrograph designed
primarily for the GALAH, Galactic Archeology Survey, the first major attempt to create a detailed understanding of
galaxy formation and evolution by studying the history of our own galaxy, the Milky Way1. The goal of the GALAH
survey is to reconstruct the mass assembly history of the of the Milky way, through a detailed spatially tagged
abundance study of one million stars in the Milky Way. The spectrograph will be based at the Anglo Australian
Telescope (AAT) and be fed with the existing 2dF robotic fibre positioning system. The spectrograph uses VPH-gratings
to achieve a spectral resolving power of 28,000 in standard mode and also provides a high resolution mode ranging
between 40,000 to 50,000 using a slit mask. The GALAH survey requires a SNR greater than 100 aiming for a star
brightness of V=14. The total spectral coverage of the four channels is about 100nm between 370 and 1000nm for up to
392 simultaneous targets within the 2 degree field of view.
Current efforts are focused on manufacturing and integration. The delivery date of spectrograph at the telescope is
scheduled for 2013. A performance prediction is presented and a complete overview of the status of the HERMES
spectrograph is given. This paper details the following specific topics:
The approach to AIT, the manufacturing and integration of the large mechanical frame, the opto-mechanical slit
assembly, collimator optics and cameras, VPH gratings, cryostats, fibre cable assembly, instrument control hardware and
software, data reduction.

	Abstract = {We investigate a new scheme for astronomical spectrograph calibration using the laser frequency comb at the Solar Vacuum Tower Telescope on Tenerife. Our concept is based upon a single-mode fiber channel, that simultaneously feeds the spectrograph with comb light and sunlight. This yields nearly perfect spatial mode matching between the two sources. In combination with the absolute calibration provided by the frequency comb, this method enables extremely robust and accurate spectroscopic measurements. The performance of this scheme is compared to a sequence of alternating comb and sunlight, and to absorption lines from Earth's atmosphere. We also show how the method can be used for radial-velocity detection by measuring the well-explored 5 min oscillations averaged over the full solar disk. Our method is currently restricted to solar spectroscopy, but with further evolving fiber-injection techniques it could become an option even for faint astronomical targets.},

	Title = {How to inject light efficiently into single-mode fibers},
	Volume = {9147},
	Year = {2014},
	Abstract = {
A key avenue to improving the precision of radial velocity measurements is by using photonic devices to collect the
light from the focal plane and delivering the beams to the slit of spectrograph via a single-mode fiber. Single-mode
fibers have the favorable property that they allow light to propagate in a single energy distribution characterized by a
Gaussian shape with a flat wavefront which is temporarily stable and independent of changes to the injection. These
properties mean that the point spread function delivered to the input slit of a spectrograph is highly stable with time
and independent of changes to the injection which is currently a key limitation to precision radial velocity
measurements and known as "Modal Noise". Further light delivery via single-mode fibers is the key requirement to
realize long baseline interferometers such as the Optical Hawaiian Array for Nanoradian Astronomy.
Injecting into single-mode fibers efficiently is inherently difficult because it requires closely matching the intensity
and wavefront of the focused beam to that supported by the fiber. The atmosphere is currently the key roadblock to
efficient injection. However, extreme adaptive optics systems such as Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive
Optics (SCExAO) system currently being commissioned will enable high order wavefront correction and make
efficient coupling into single-mode fibers possible. In addition, pupil apodization optics used for coronagraphy,
known as phase induced amplitude apodization lenses also present in the SCExAO instrument, allow for close
matching of the intensity distributions.
We report on the progress and lessons learnt on developing an efficient single-mode injection unit within the
SCExAO instrument. As part of the PANDORA project we aim to use this injection and combine it with several
other photonic technologies to enable high precision radial velocity measurements in new and innovative ways.

Those results which are comparable are in agreement with the findings of Hufnagel and Stanley who studied the average modulation transfer function of long-exposure images. It is found that the average short-exposure resolution can be significantly better than the average long-exposure resolution, but only if the wave distortion does not include substantial intensity variation.},

The ability to position multiple miniaturized wavefront sensors precisely over large focal surfaces are advantageous to
multi-object adaptive optics. The Australian Astronomical Observatory (AAO) has prototyped a compact and lightweight
Shack-Hartmann wavefront-sensor that fits into a standard Starbug parallel fibre positioning robot. Each device makes
use of a polymer coherent fibre imaging bundle to relay an image produced by a microlens array placed at the telescope
focal plane to a re-imaging camera mounted elsewhere. The advantages of the polymer fibre bundle are its high-fill
factor, high-throughput, low weight, and relatively low cost. Multiple devices can also be multiplexed to a single lownoise
camera for cost efficiencies per wavefront sensor. The use of fibre bundles also opens the possibility of
applications such as telescope field acquisition, guiding, and seeing monitors to be positioned by Starbugs. We present
the design aspects, simulations and laboratory test results.

TAIPAN is a spectroscopic instrument designed for the UK Schmidt Telescope at the Australian Astronomical Observatory. In addition to undertaking the TAIPAN survey, it will serve as a prototype for the MANIFEST fibre positioner system for the future Giant Magellan Telescope. The design for TAIPAN incorporates up to 300 optical fibres situated within independently-controlled robotic positioners known as Starbugs, allowing precise parallel positioning of every fibre, thus significantly reducing instrument configuration time and increasing observing time. We describe the design of the TAIPAN instrument system, as well as the science that will be accomplished by the TAIPAN survey. We also highlight results from the on-sky tests performed in May 2014 with Starbugs on the UK Schmidt Telescope and briefly introduce the role that Starbugs will play in MANIFEST.

	Abstract = {The Birmingham Solar Oscillations Network (BiSON) has provided high-quality high-cadence observations from as far back in time as 1978. These data must be calibrated from the raw observations into radial velocity and the quality of the calibration has a large impact on the signal-to-noise ratio of the final time series. The aim of this work is to maximize the potential science that can be performed with the BiSON data set by optimizing the calibration procedure. To achieve better levels of signal-to-noise ratio, we perform two key steps in the calibration process: we attempt a correction for terrestrial atmospheric differential extinction; and the resulting improvement in the calibration allows us to perform weighted averaging of contemporaneous data from different BiSON stations. The improvements listed produce significant improvement in the signal-to-noise ratio of the BiSON frequency--power spectrum across all frequency ranges. The reduction of noise in the power spectrum will allow future work to provide greater constraint on changes in the oscillation spectrum with solar activity.

In a SDM system, minimizing the coupling loss and mode-dependent loss best utilizes all spatial modes of the fiber which increases the capacity, the transmission distance, and minimizes the outage probability. We use modal analysis, the beam propagation method, and a transfer matrix technique to analyze the lanterns throughput along with its mode dependent loss and show that unitary coupling between single-mode fibers and a multi-mode fiber is only possible by optimizing the arrangements of the cores. Results include simulations for three, 12, 15, and 51 core lanterns to couple to six, 24, 30, and 102 spatial and polarization modes, respectively.},

	Abstract = {
The Visible Integral-field Replicable Unit Spectrograph (VIRUS) consists of a baseline build of 150 identical
spectrographs (arrayed as 75 units, each with a pair of spectrographs) fed by 33,600 fibers, each 1.5 arcsec diameter,
deployed over the 22 arcminute field of the upgraded 10 m Hobby-Eberly Telescope (HET). The goal is to deploy 82
units. VIRUS has a fixed bandpass of 350-550 nm and resolving power R~700. VIRUS is the first example of
industrial-scale replication applied to optical astronomy and is capable of spectral surveys of large areas of sky. This
approach, in which a relatively simple, inexpensive, unit spectrograph is copied in large numbers, offers significant
savings of engineering effort, cost, and schedule when compared to traditional instruments.
The main motivator for VIRUS is to map the evolution of dark energy for the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy
Experiment (HETDEX) using 0.8M Lyman-α emitting galaxies as tracers. The full VIRUS array is due to be deployed
by early 2014 and will provide a powerful new facility instrument for the HET, well suited to the survey niche of the
telescope. VIRUS and HET will open up wide-field surveys of the emission-line universe for the first time. We present
the production design and current status of VIRUS.

The Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) is a 25.4-m diameter, optical/infrared telescope that is being built by an international consortium of universities and research institutions as one of the next generation of Extremely Large Telescopes. The primary mirror of GMT consists of seven 8.4 m borosilicate honeycomb mirror segments that are optically conjugate to seven corresponding segments in the Gregorian secondary mirror. Fabrication is complete for one primary mirror segment and is underway for the next two. The final focal ratio of the telescope is f/8.2, so that the focal plane has an image scale of 1.02 arcsec/mm. GMT will be commissioned using a fast-steering secondary mirror assembly comprised of conventional, rigid segments to provide seeing-limited observations. A secondary mirror with fully adaptive segments will be used in standard operation to additionally enable ground-layer and diffraction-limited adaptive optics. In the seeing limited mode, GMT will provide a 10 arcmin field of view without field correction. A 20 arcmin field of view will be obtained using a wide-field corrector and atmospheric dispersion compensator. The project has recently completed a series of sub-system and system-level preliminary design reviews and is currently preparing to move into the construction phase. This paper summarizes the technical development of the GMT sub-systems and the current status of the GMT project.

The Giant Magellan Telescope (GMT) is a 25.4-m diameter, optical/infrared telescope that is being built by an international consortium of universities and research institutions as one of the next generation of Extremely Large Telescopes. The primary mirror of GMT consists of seven 8.4 m borosilicate honeycomb mirror segments that are optically conjugate to seven corresponding segments in the Gregorian secondary mirror. Fabrication is complete for one primary mirror segment and is underway for the next two. The final focal ratio of the telescope is f/8.2, so that the focal plane has an image scale of 1.02 arcsec/mm. GMT will be commissioned using a fast-steering secondary mirror assembly comprised of conventional, rigid segments to provide seeing-limited observations. A secondary mirror with fully adaptive segments will be used in standard operation to additionally enable ground-layer and diffraction-limited adaptive optics. In the seeing limited mode, GMT will provide a 10 arcmin field of view without field correction. A 20 arcmin field of view will be obtained using a wide-field corrector and atmospheric dispersion compensator. The project has recently completed a series of sub-system and system-level preliminary design reviews and is currently preparing to move into the construction phase. This paper summarizes the technical development of the GMT sub-systems and the current status of the GMT project.

It is thus possible to compare the luminosities of the three types of instruments with, in each case, equal resolving power and equal dimension. This comparison reveals a great superiority of the grating over the prism for all regions of wavelengths, and a great superiority of the \&\#x00E9;talon over the grating. In the case of the \&\#x00E9;talon, the overlapping may be overcome by the use of several \&\#x00E9;talons in series.},

	Abstract = {Microwave Kinetic Inductance Detectors, or MKIDs, have proven to be a powerful cryogenic detector technology due to their sensitivity and the ease with which they can be multiplexed into large arrays. A MKID is an energy sensor based on a photon-variable superconducting inductance in a lithographed microresonator, and is capable of functioning as a photon detector across the electromagnetic spectrum as well as a particle detector. Here we describe the first successful effort to create a photon-counting, energy-resolving ultraviolet, optical, and near infrared MKID focal plane array. These new Optical Lumped Element (OLE) MKID arrays have significant advantages over semiconductor detectors like charge coupled devices (CCDs). They can count individual photons with essentially no false counts and determine the energy and arrival time of every photon with good quantum efficiency. Their physical pixel size and maximum count rate is well matched with large telescopes. These capabilities enable powerful new astrophysical instruments usable from the ground and space.

Dimension reduction is accomplished using a custom 2D to 1D square fiber-optic array that is made by using approximately 600 individual 25 micron square fibers. The technique allows the concurrent detection of multiple analytes and is demonstrated using a combination CO2/O2 sensor, in two different sensor configurations. The technique is being extended for lifetime-based image-guide sensors.},

We used these red and blue astro-combs to calibrate a high-resolution astrophysical spectrograph integrated with a 1.5 m telescope, and demonstrated calibration precision and stability sufficient to enable detection of changes in stellar radial velocity \&lt; 1 m/s.},

	Abstract = {We present results from the first on-sky demonstration of a prototype astronomical integrated photonic spectrograph (IPS) using the Anglo-Australian Telescope near-infrared imaging spectrometer (IRIS2) at Siding Spring Observatory to observe atmospheric molecular OH emission lines. We have succeeded in detecting upwards of 27 lines, and demonstrated the practicality of the IPS device for astronomy. Furthermore, we present a laboratory characterization of the device, which is a modified version of a commercial arrayed-waveguide grating multiplexer. We measure the spectral resolution full-width-half-maximum to be 0.75 {\textpm} 0.05nm (giving R $=$ $\lambda$/$\delta$$\lambda$ $=$ 2100 {\textpm} 150 at 1500nm). We find the free spectral range to be 57.4 {\textpm} 0.6nm and the peak total efficiency to be ~65\%. Finally, we briefly discuss the future steps required to realize an astronomical instrument based on this technology concept.},
